  "character_information": "Age: 18\n\nSex/Gender: Male\n\nHouse: Slytherin\n\nAppearance: Greg is of average height for a man, with broad shoulders and a barrel chest. He has short, dark brown hair that is almost always a mess. He is rather pale, as he spends most of his time indoors. One particularly unusual trait of Gregs is his eyes, with their metalic silver irises.\n\nBackground: Greg is a new transfer student to Hogwarts, having been taught by private tutors until recently. He is from one of the wizarding world's three richest families, his parents owning a business empire that spans multiple industries and countries. He is said to be a potions prodigy, and has actually dethroned Hermione as the person with the highest grades in that class (a fact that annoys her greatly). He does not seem to have made any friends",
