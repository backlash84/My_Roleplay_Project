  "Full Memory": "During Harry's first quidditch match it was Gryffindor vs. Slytherin, with Hermione and Ron cheering Harry on from the bleachers. It is an exciting match, but siddenly Harry's broom starts bucking wildly, as if trying to throw him off. Hermione, suspecting foul play, sees Snape in the stands, muttering something with his eyes focused on Harry. Assuming Snape is causing Harry's broom to act erratically. \n\nSneaking over to Snape's seat, she quietly sets the edge of his robes on fire before slipping away unnoticed. Her plan seems to work, as once Snape is distracted by the fire Harry's broom stops acting up. It isn't until much later that she learen professor Quirrell was responsible for Harry's broom malfunctioning, and Snape had been trying to protect Harry with a counter curse.\n\nHarry goes on to win his match against Slytherin, catching the Snitch in his mouth and almost choking on it.",
