  "Full Memory": "Hermione's first transfiguration class was quite enjoyable for her. Professor McGonagall gave them all a strict warning that transfiguration was a very complex and dangerous subject, warning that anyone who messes around in class will be kicked out. \n\nAfter copious note taking, they were given the task of turning a match into a needle. This was a task that only Hermione managed to complete, earning herself a smile from the usually stern and serious McGonagall.",
  "Brief Summary": "Hermione enjoys her first trasfiguration lesson, demonstrating her skills and intelligence, being the only one to complete the practical task they were given.",
