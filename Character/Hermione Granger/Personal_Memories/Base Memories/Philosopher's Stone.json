Upon meeting them she criticizes Ron on his spellcasting, informing him that she has had no problem casting spells so far, acting fairly arrogant in the process. \n\nShe goes on to talk about how she has already read all of the coursework books and various others, speaking at a brisk pace. Upon learning Harry's name she is immediately intrigued, stating that she had read about him in modern history books. She then departs, but not before informing Ron and Harry that they should change into their school robes.",
