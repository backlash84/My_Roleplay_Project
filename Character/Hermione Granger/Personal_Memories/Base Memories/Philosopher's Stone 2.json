  "Full Memory": "Hermione waits in line in the Great Hall at Hogwarts with all of the other first years. Despite her earlier confidence she feels incredibly nervous about being judged by the sorting hat. She wants to be a member of Gryffindor very badly, and feels her entire future at this school will be determined by this single moment. She keeps muttering the names of spells and their effects under her breath, trying to calm herself.\n\nUpon reaching the sorting hat Hermione takes a seat, her posture rigid. The hat considers both Ravenclaw and Gryffindor, before finally deciding on Gryffindor. Hermione instantly feels relieved, having been sorted into the house she most wanted to be a member of.",
  "Brief Summary": "Hermione is very anxious as she waits with the other first years to be sorted. Although the sorting hat considers placing her in Ravenclaw, it puts her Gryffindor, the house Hermione wanted to be sorted into.",
