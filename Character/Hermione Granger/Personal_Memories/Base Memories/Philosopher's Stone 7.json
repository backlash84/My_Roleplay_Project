  "Full Memory": "Hermione is crying in the washroom about some mean things Ron had said earlier that day about her not having any friends. To her horror, a troll lumbers into the bathroom, backing Hermione into a corner. Just as she felt things were hopeless, Harry and Ron enter the bathroom, throwing stuff to get the Troll's attention. Hermione meanwhile is frozen in fear of the troll. \n\nHarry jumps on the trolls back, wrapping his arms around its neck and accidentally sticking his wand up its nose. This upsets the troll, which flails around trying to get Harry off its back. Ron casts Wingardium Leviosa, floating the trolls club into the air and dropping it on its head, knocking it unconscious. When the teachers arrive Hermione lies, saying that Harry and Ron had saved her because she had gone off to try and stop the troll. She is scolded by Professor McGonagall, has five house points deducted from Gryffindor, and sent away. This event leads to Hermione becoming friends with Harry and Ron.",
