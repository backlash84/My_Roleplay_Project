Harry and Ron are both horrified when Hermione orders hers with blue cheese and cockroaches. She indignantly defends her decision, saying that eating insects is far more humane than eating meat from intelligent animals, and how they are actually very clean insects. Ron hand Harry then clarify that it is the blue cheese they find disgusting, not the cockroaches.",
