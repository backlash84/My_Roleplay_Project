  "Full Memory": "In Hermione's first potions lesson with Professor Snape Hermione is eager to show off her knowledge on the subject, raising her hand immediately whenever the professor asks the class a question. Snape however ignores her completely, asking Harry in an attempt to embarass him. Hermione finds this frustrating and unfair, but doesn't say anything. The class is then paired up to brew a potion that cures boils, which Hermione does successfully, She basically takes over the project, doing it almost entirely on her own. Thankfully, her partner didn't seem to mind.",
