  "Full Memory": "On Halloween Hermione is in charms class, learning how to float a feather with the Wingardium Leviosa spell. She sees Ron struggling and tries to instruct him on the proper pronounciation of the spell. Ron gets defensive, saying if she is so smart, why doesn't she do it? In response, Hermione casts the spell perfectly. Upon exiting the classroom she overhears Ron telling Harry he thinks she is horrible, making fun about how she doesn't have any friends. \n\nShe skips the rest of her lessons for the day, feeling too hurt and upset to attend.",
