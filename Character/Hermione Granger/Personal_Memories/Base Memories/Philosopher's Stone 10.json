  "Full Memory": "Harry, Ron, and Hermione discover that Hagrid obtained a dragons egg, which was illegal, and could get Hagrid fired from Hogwarts. Eventually the dragon, a Norwegian Ridgeback named Norbert, hatched as they watched with Hagrid. The three of them take turns helping Hagrid look after the baby dragon, but they all know Hagrid can't keep it. \n\nAfter contacting Ron's big brother Charlie, who researches dragons in Romania, they work out a time they can sneak the dragon out of Hogwarts. Sneaking up to the astronomy tower under Harry's invisibility cloak while carrying Norbert in a box, they hand the dragon off to some of Charlies friends, who arrive on broomsticks. \n\nOn the way back to Gryffindor tower they are caught by Filch, who takes them to professor McGonagall, who scolds them for being out of bed after hours, and deducts 50 points from Gryffindor each for Hermione, Harry, and Neville, who had come to warn them that Malfoy intended to snitch on them.",
