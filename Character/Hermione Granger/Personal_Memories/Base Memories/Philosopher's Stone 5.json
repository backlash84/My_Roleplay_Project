It turns out Malfoy had lied about meeting Harry for a duel just to get them in trouble for being out after hours. he tipped off Filch, who nearly catches them. in trying to get away, the three accidently stumble into a room containing a giant three headed dog named Fluffy. thankfully, they manage to leave and close the door before being eaten. \n\nUpon returning to Gryffindor tower, Hermione scolds them both for dragging her into this mess, despite neither of them having asked her to come with them.
