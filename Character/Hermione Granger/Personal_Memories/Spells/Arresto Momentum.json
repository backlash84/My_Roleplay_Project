  "Other": "This charm was invented by the witch Daisy Pennifold in 1711 so it could be used to slow down falling Quaffles in Quidditch matches, allowing for Chasers to grab them in mid-air. Likely the combination of two words; the Anglo-French \"arester\", meaning \"to bring to a stop\", and the Latin \"Momentum\", meaning \"the force or strength gained whilst moving\". Literal translation: \"bring its momentum to a stop\"."
