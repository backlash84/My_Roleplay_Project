  "Full Memory": "Harry and Ron decide to follow the spiders as per Hagrid's advice, walking with Fang as their guide along the trails of spiders, which are strangely all fleeing Hogwarts. This takes them into the Forbidden Forest. Even though Ron is deeply arachnophobic, Hermione having been petrified and that they may be able to help through this investigation gives him the willpower to go along anyway. The two boys follow the spiders deeper into the forest all the way into a webbed lair. There, they are met by a now adult but ageing Aragog, who reveals that Hagrid is innocent and explains his past from being given to Hagrid as an egg by a distant traveller to his accusation as the Chamber's resident monster until his transfer to the Forbidden Forest and his founding of his colony with Mosag. When Harry asks of the monster that killed the girl in 1943, Aragog remarks it is an ancient creature that all spiders as well as giant ones fear and that they never mention its name nor speak about it, even when Hagrid asked many times, and adds that the dead girl was found in a bathroom. Harry and Ron thank him and turn to leave, but Aragog halts them, deciding to leave them as dinner for his children. Mr Weasley's Ford Anglia comes blasting through the layers of spiders, however, and enables the boys and Fang to escape. After this, Harry and Ron feel that they have reached dead ends everywhere, until one possible last hope occurs to them. Recalling Aragog's remarks of the dead girl in the bathroom Harry suggests that Moaning Myrtle might have been that victim.",

As his children attack, the boys escape thanks to the enchanted car. They realize the dead girl might be Moaning Myrtle.",
