  "Full Memory": "When Harry and Ron go to the staff room, they overhear the teachers talking about another attack having occurred. Harry and Ron decide to hide to hear more details and discover that Ginny has been kidnapped by the Basilisk, and the heir of Slytherin has left another message under the previous one: \"HER SKELETON WILL LIE IN THE CHAMBER FOREVER\". Harry and Ron also discover that Hogwarts will be closed tomorrow. The teachers then force Lockhart to deal with the monster, as he has been claiming he could handle whatever is behind the attacks. Looking very crestfallen, he leaves for his room. Harry and Ron decide that if Lockhart is going to deal with the monster they might as well tell him what they know. They go to his room, only to find him frantically planning to run away. When questioned on why such a talented wizard as himself is leaving, Lockhart admits that he is a fraud who put Memory Charms on the people who really did the things that he claimed to have done in his books. He then attempts to put a Memory Charm on the two boys as well, but they manage to disarm him and, under wand threats, take him to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.",
