  "Full Memory": "Scabbers escapes from Ron. Harry, Ron, and Hermione chase him and spot the black dog and Crookshanks. Ron catches Scabbers, but the dog grabs him, dragging him into a passage under the Whomping Willow and breaking his leg. Harry, Hermione, and Crookshanks follow to the Shrieking Shack, finding Ron, Scabbers, and Sirius Black \u2014 the black dog\u2019s true form.\n\nLupin arrives, accused by Hermione of aiding Black and being a werewolf. Lupin admits to the latter, denies helping Black, and explains he tracked them via the Marauder\u2019s Map, where he also saw Peter Pettigrew alive. Pettigrew, an Animagus, has lived for years as Scabbers.\n\nThe trio doubt him, citing Pettigrew\u2019s supposed murder by Black. Lupin urges Black to explain. Lupin recounts being bitten as a child and how Dumbledore arranged the Shrieking Shack and Whomping Willow to contain him during transformations. Eventually, Sirius, Pettigrew, and James Potter discovered the truth and became Animagi to accompany him. Lupin never told Dumbledore Sirius was one, fearing punishment for enabling them. Snape suddenly arrives, using Harry\u2019s Invisibility Cloak.\n\nSnape tries to arrest Lupin and Black, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione disarm him. Black says he escaped Azkaban after seeing Scabbers in the paper and recognizing Pettigrew. He suspected Pettigrew intended to capture Harry for Voldemort. Black reveals Pettigrew had been the Potters\u2019 Secret-Keeper \u2014 chosen at the last moment instead of Sirius, a change even Dumbledore didn\u2019t know. Sirius hadn\u2019t realized Pettigrew was already a spy for Voldemort, who betrayed the Potters immediately. After their deaths, Sirius confronted Pettigrew, who killed twelve Muggles, cut off his finger, transformed into a rat, and escaped, framing Black.\n\nBlack and Lupin force Scabbers to transform, revealing Pettigrew. Black says Pettigrew stayed with the Weasleys to monitor news until it was safe to return to Voldemort. Learning Pettigrew might soon act against Harry, Black escaped Azkaban in Animagus form to find him. He swears to Harry he\u2019d have died before betraying his parents. Harry believes him.\n\nThe group takes Pettigrew back toward the castle, intending to deliver him to the Dementors.",
