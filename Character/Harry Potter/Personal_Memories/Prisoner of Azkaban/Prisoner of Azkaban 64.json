  "Full Memory": "Harry, Hermione, and Ron are taken to the Hospital Wing, and Black is taken to West Tower, where he is sentenced to a Dementor's Kiss. When Dumbledore arrives, Harry and Hermione try to tell him what actually happened, but Dumbledore tells them that, though he believes them, he cannot save Black, as the evidence against him is too great.\nHermione then reveals she has a Time-Turner, a device that will take them back through time. McGonagall gave the device to her during the Sorting on their first day back; this explains why throughout the year, there had been occasions of Hermione taking multiple classes at the same time and apparently disappearing into thin air.\nHarry and Hermione travel three hours into the past, watching themselves move through previous events. They realize that Dumbledore wanted them to travel three hours back to not only save Buckbeak from being wrongfully executed, but also to use Buckbeak to free Black from West Tower. After narrowly rescuing Buckbeak at the right moment before Macnair can execute him, Harry and Hermione hide near the Whomping Willow in the Forbidden Forest to wait for the \"other Harry and Hermione\" and everyone else to return from the Shrieking Shack.\nAfter two hours, following Lupin's transformation, Harry decides they need to head back to Hagrid's empty cabin so Lupin doesn't attack them. After spending some time in hiding, Harry leaves the cabin to check out the present situation and sees himself, Hermione, and Black fainting from Dementors. He realises that the silver stag he saw earlier across the lake was not cast by his dad, but rather by himself, and conjures a powerful Patronus that drives all the Dementors away. When it returns to him, he realises that it was the same Patronus as his father.\nHe and Hermione then fly Buckbeak up to West Tower and rescue Black. Harry and Sirius say their goodbyes before Sirius flies away on Buckbeak.",
