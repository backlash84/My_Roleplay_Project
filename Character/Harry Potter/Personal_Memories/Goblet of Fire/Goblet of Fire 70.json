  "Full Memory": "While at the Top Box in the World Cup stadium, Harry meets Winky the house-elf, a friend of Dobby's, who is saving a seat for Mr Crouch (who never shows up). The Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge, as well as Lucius Malfoy with his wife and Draco (though both the Weasleys and Malfoys have to restrain themselves out of respect for Fudge), are also in the box. After Bagman introduces both teams' mascots, the match is intense and exciting, with amazing skill displayed on both sides, particularly from Krum. A fight breaks out between the two team's mascots after Ireland is awarded many penalty shots, which angers the Veela.\n\nIreland quickly gains a massive lead and wins the match, despite Krum catching the Golden Snitch. After the match, both teams head to the Top Box and Fudge awards Ireland the Quidditch World Cup, while Fred and George rejoice about winning their bet with Bagman.",
