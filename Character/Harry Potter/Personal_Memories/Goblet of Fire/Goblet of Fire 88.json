  "Full Memory": "Sirius meets Harry, Ron, and Hermione secretly in Hogsmeade and directs them to a mountain cave where Buckbeak and some old Daily Prophet articles are waiting. They first discuss Winky and what happened at the World Cup. Sirius suggests that whoever stole Harry's wand must have done so while they were watching the game in the Top Box, and is suspicious that Barty Crouch was looking around for something before he sacked Winky. He then finds it odd that not only did Crouch not show up during the game, but also that he is suddenly indisposed.\nSirius explains that Crouch was the one who sent him to Azkaban without a trial, as Crouch used to be the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and was once poised to become the next Minister for Magic. During Voldemort's previous reign, Crouch took extreme measures against the Death Eaters, including allowing the Aurors to use the Unforgivable Curses against them. While this greatly boosted Crouch's popularity and ensured that Crouch would become the next Minister, Crouch's son had been caught with a group of Death Eaters just after Voldemort's downfall. He was given a show trial by his father before being locked up in Azkaban; he died a year later.\nRon brings up Crouch's appearance in Snape's office. Sirius states that doesn't make sense. Sirius says it is questionable why Dumbledore would trust Snape. Snape was interested in the Dark Arts as a child and hung out with some Slytherin students that became Death Eaters.\n\nSirius then brings all the questions of these mysterious circumstances together, including why Moody was also searching Snape's office. He asks Ron to send a letter to Percy to find out if there is any news about Crouch. Sirius reminds them not to wander outside Hogwarts at all for safety reasons.",
