  "Full Memory": "During Divination class Harry passes out and has a vision. He sees Voldemort being informed of someone's death and torturing Wormtail for failing to prevent that person from escaping. Harry awakens with his scar hurting badly and pretends he has to go to the Hospital Wing. Harry actually goes to see Dumbledore. After spending time trying to get the password to Dumbledore's office right, Harry overhears an argument between Dumbledore, Moody, and Cornelius Fudge regarding the Barty Crouch situation. Fudge refuses to believe the words that Crouch said about Bertha Jorkins being dead, and while debating what happened to Crouch, Fudge suggests that Madame Maxime is the likely culprit given her half-giant physiology. Dumbledore accuses Fudge of acting on personal prejudice, which Fudge ignores due to Dumbledore's friendship with Hagrid. Moody interrupts the debate to explain that Harry Potter has arrived.",

There, he overhears Dumbledore, Moody, and Fudge arguing about Crouch. Fudge dismisses Crouch\u2019s claims and wrongly suspects Madame Maxime.",
