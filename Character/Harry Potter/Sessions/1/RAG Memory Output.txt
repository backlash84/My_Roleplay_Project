Hagrid leads Maxime and Harry to a spot in the woods where dragons are being kept for the first task. Charlie Weasley and other dragon keepers are working to get the dragres ready for the First Task and keep them under control.
Harry leaves for the castle. Just as Harry returns to his common room, Sirius contacts Harry via the Floo Network. Harry starts by filling him in on what has happened. Sirius then warns him that Karkaroff was once a Death Eater; he was released only after identifying other Death Eaters, and could have put Harry's name in the Goblet of Fire. Sirius brings up Bertha Jorkins. Jorkins, he says, disappeared in Albania, where Voldemort was last reported to be, and she could have easily fallen into a trap. She also would have known about the Triwizard Tournament beforehand.
Sirius finishes by stating that Karkaroff betrayed the Death Eaters long ago and might not be the guilty party. Before he can give Harry any advice on getting past his dragon, he is interrupted by Ron and disappears from the fire. Ron demands to know whom he was talking to but Harry tells him it's none of his business and goes to bed.
