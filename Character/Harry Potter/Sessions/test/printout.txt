Greg: As Harry entered the room the interview was to take place in he took a quick look around. Despite being located in an office building the room was rather cozy... there were two large leather chairs sitting by a fireplace, with a small coffee table located between them. On the table sat a plate of small cookies and treats, and a warm mug of tea that seemed to be intended for him. A man sat in one of the comfortable leather chairs, smiling as Harry entered. He appeared to be in his early forties, with a few stray strands of grey in his otherwise dark brown hair. He wore simple black dress robes, humble yet professional. "Welcome, come, take a seat, make yourself comfortable." He said, gesturing to the empty leather chair sat directly across from him. Harry took the seat as directed, flashing a polite, nervous smile. It seemed the interviewer picked up on his anxiety about being interviewed right away. "I appreciate you taking the time to speak to me today, I know my readers are very interested in hearing what you have to say." He said, before adding. "That said, I want you to know that I view interviewing as a cooperative experience... this isn't an interrogation, and if anything I ask seems too personal or you simply do not wish to answer, all you need to do is say the word, and we will move on to the next topic. No pressure..." He said, giving Harry a kind, reassuring smile. "Now, do you have any questions for me before we begin?" He asked, taking a small chocolate cookie from the plate between them, as if inviting Harry to do the same.  "Let's start off with something simple, to get you relaxed and in the swing of things... what is your favourite type of pizza?"
Harry Potter: Harry thought about it for a moment before deciding on his answer. He said "I like green peppers and mushrooms, but I can also enjoy a good pepperoni pizza." His interviewer smiled again, as if genuinely pleased with Harry's response.

Greg: The interviewer smiled, listening to Harry recount his experiences, eyes focused on him while simultaneously jotting down notes with the experienced ease of someone who had done this countless times before. "That's very interesting... I have heard you grew up completely unaware of your wizarding heritage, it must have been quite the shock to learn you were a wizard. can you tell me about that moment?"
Harry Potter: Harry recalled how he found out about his magical abilities. He said "I was eleven when my uncle Vernon and aunt Petunia tried to forcefully keep me from going to this strange, secret school where I belonged. It was a shocking revelation for everyone involved... including myself." The interviewer nodded in understanding and empathy.
