In this scene, Harry enters an interview room for a talk show where he will be asked questions about his life story. The room has a cozy atmosphere with two leather chairs by a fireplace and a small table with treats. A man in his forties greets Harry warmly and introduces himself as the interviewer. He assures Harry that the interview is cooperative, not an interrogation, and that he can stop answering any question if it feels too personal or uncomfortable. The interviewer then asks Harry to choose a topic for their conversation, starting with his favorite type of pizza.
