The interviewer, around 40 years old, greeted him warmly and offered reassurance that the conversation would be cooperative. He asked if Harry had any questions before starting, and then suggested they begin with an easy topic: Harry's favorite type of pizza.\n<<<END ROLLING HISTORY SUMMARY>>>\n\nNow respond to my latest message while following the rules in the prefix.\n\nLatest user message:\nAs Harry entered the room the interview was to take place in he took a quick look around. Despite being located in an office building the room was rather cozy... there were two large leather chairs sitting by a fireplace, with a small coffee table located between them. On the table sat a plate of small cookies and treats, and a warm mug of tea that seemed to be intended for him. A man sat in one of the comfortable leather chairs, smiling as Harry entered. He appeared to be in his early forties, with a few stray strands of grey in his otherwise dark brown hair. He wore simple black dress robes, humble yet professional. \"Welcome, come, take a seat, make yourself comfortable.\" He said, gesturing to the empty leather chair sat directly across from him. Harry took the seat as directed, flashing a polite, nervous smile. It seemed the interviewer picked up on his anxiety about being interviewed right away. \"I appreciate you taking the time to speak to me today, I know my readers are very interested in hearing what you have to say.\" He said, before adding. \"That said, I want you to know that I view interviewing as a cooperative experience... this isn't an interrogation, and if anything I ask seems too personal or you simply do not wish to answer, all you need to do is say the word, and we will move on to the next topic. No pressure...\" He said, giving Harry a kind, reassuring smile. \"Now, do you have any questions for me before we begin?\" He asked, taking a small chocolate cookie from the plate between them, as if inviting Harry to do the same.  \"Let's start off with something simple, to get you relaxed and in the swing of things... what is your favourite type of pizza?\""}],"temperature":0.7,"frequency_penalty":0.3,"presence_penalty":0.3,"stop":[],"stream":false}
