[PERSPECTIVE: Second Hand]
Harry goes out with Hermione and Ron to a Pizza Place that lets you pick any toppings you can image. Hermione and Ron are both horrified when Harry orders his with blue cheese and cockroaches. He indignantly defends his decision, saying that eating insects is far more humane than eating meat from intelligent animals, and how they are actually very clean insects. Ron hand Hermione then clarify that it is the blue cheese they find disgusting, not the cockroaches.

[PERSPECTIVE: First Hand]
Harry's impending talk with Sirius helps him through his embarrassment about Rita Skeeter's news article, which told a highly inaccurate version of his life story. This further deepens the rift with Ron, who thinks Harry is trying to get attention. Ravenclaw Cho Chang is the only person outside of Gryffindor who wishes Harry good luck with the first task that is coming up on that Tuesday. Harry finds himself infatuated with her.

Hagrid asks Harry to meet him at midnight, one hour before his meeting with Sirius.
The Gamekeeper sneaks Harry into a meeting with Maxime; she does not know Harry, who is again hidden under his cloak, is there. Hagrid leads Maxime and Harry to a spot in the woods where dragons are being kept for the first task. Charlie Weasley and other dragon keepers are working to get the dragons ready for the First Task and keep them under control. Harry leaves for the castle.
Just as Harry returns to his common room, Sirius contacts Harry via the Floo Network. Harry starts by filling him in on what has happened. Sirius then speaks and warns him that Karkaroff was once a Death Eater; he was released only after identifying other Death Eaters, and could have put Harry's name in the Goblet of Fire. Sirius brings up Bertha Jorkins. Jorkins, he says, disappeared in Albania, where Voldemort was last reported to be, and she could have easily fallen into a trap. She also would have known about the Triwizard Tournament beforehand.

Sirius finishes by stating that Karkaroff betrayed the Death Eaters long ago and might not be the guilty party. Before he can give Harry any advice on getting past his dragon, he is interrupted by Ron and disappears from the fire. Ron demands to know whom he was talking to but Harry tells him it's none of his business and goes to bed.

[PERSPECTIVE: First Hand]
Harry meets with Cedric's parents. They do not blame him for what happened and are thankful to have his body, but decline Harry's offer of the winnings.
During the Leaving Feast, a memorial feast for Cedric is held, where Dumbledore tells the school what has happened in the graveyard despite the Ministry's wishes that he keep it secret. Fleur and Krum both say good-bye to the trio before they take their carriage to the Hogwarts Express.
Hermione reveals that she has discovered that Rita Skeeter is an unregistered animagus who can turn into a beetle. Hermione caught Skeeter in a jar in the Hospital Wing after the third task. Hermione assures Harry and Ron that her stories will trouble them no longer, since she told Rita that if the stories continued, she would tell the Ministry about her secret.
Just as Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle arrive and taunt Harry over Voldemort's return, they are rendered unconscious from hexes used by both the trio and Fred and George Weasley. Harry, Ron, and George then began kicking, rolling, and pushing the unconscious Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle into a spot where they will be out of the way. Soon another mystery is solved: The person that Fred and George were hinted to have been blackmailing was Ludo Bagman. When the twins won their bet, he paid them their winnings at the Quidditch World Cup in Leprechaun gold and wouldn't even return their original wager.

The twins reveal that Bagman has a long-time problem with gambling and he made a bet that Harry would win the tournament to get his money back, which is why he was trying to help Harry cheat. However, since Harry and Cedric actually "tied" for first place, Bagman has gone on the run. Harry gives the twins his Triwizard Winnings to help them with their dream of running a joke shop. Everyone then say their good-byes as Harry prepares to leave with Vernon Dursley.

[role=user] As Harry entered the room the interview was to take place in he took a quick look around. Despite being located in an office building the room was rather cozy... there were two large leather chairs sitting by a fireplace, with a small coffee table located between them. On the table sat a plate of small cookies and treats, and a warm mug of tea that seemed to be intended for him. A man sat in one of the comfortable leather chairs, smiling as Harry entered. He appeared to be in his early forties, with a few stray strands of grey in his otherwise dark brown hair. He wore simple black dress robes, humble yet professional. "Welcome, come, take a seat, make yourself comfortable." He said, gesturing to the empty leather chair sat directly across from him. Harry took the seat as directed, flashing a polite, nervous smile. It seemed the interviewer picked up on his anxiety about being interviewed right away. "I appreciate you taking the time to speak to me today, I know my readers are very interested in hearing what you have to say." He said, before adding. "That said, I want you to know that I view interviewing as a cooperative experience... this isn't an interrogation, and if anything I ask seems too personal or you simply do not wish to answer, all you need to do is say the word, and we will move on to the next topic. No pressure..." He said, giving Harry a kind, reassuring smile. "Now, do you have any questions for me before we begin?" He asked, taking a small chocolate cookie from the plate between them, as if inviting Harry to do the same.  "Let's start off with something simple, to get you relaxed and in the swing of things... what is your favourite type of pizza?"
